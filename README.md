#  Report on MQ135 Gas Sensor

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
The **MQ135 gas sensor** is a widely used air quality sensor capable of detecting gases such as **ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ), nitrogen oxides (NOâ‚“), alcohol, benzene, smoke, and carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚)**. It is commonly used in **air quality monitoring systems, IoT projects, and pollution detection devices** due to its **low cost and sensitivity**.During my study of the MQ135 datasheet, I observed that calibration plays a key role in accuracy and reliable detection of gases.

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
The MQ135 sensor works on the principle of **changes in resistance** of its sensitive layer (**SnOâ‚‚ â€“ tin dioxide**) when exposed to target gases.

- In **clean air**, SnOâ‚‚ has **higher resistance**.  
- When **pollutant gases** are present, the resistance **drops** due to adsorption of gas molecules on the sensorâ€™s surface.  
- This change is measured as **voltage variation** across the load resistance (RL), which can be calibrated to indicate **gas concentration in ppm**.

## ðŸ”¹ Calibration
Calibration is essential because different gases produce different responses.

1. Place the sensor in a **known concentration** of target gas.  
2. Record the sensor resistance (**Rs**).  
3. Calculate the ratio **Rs/Râ‚€**, where **Râ‚€** is the sensor resistance in clean air.  

### Example Detectable Levels:
- **Ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ):** Detectable from ~10 ppm  
- **Carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚):** Detectable from ~350 ppm  
- **Benzene:** Detectable from ~10 ppm  
- **Alcohol & Smoke:** Detectable from ~10 ppm  

Each gas has a **characteristic Rs/Râ‚€ vs ppm curve** from the datasheet.

## ðŸ”¹ Freundlich Absorption Isotherm (Graph)
The sensorâ€™s gas adsorption behavior follows the **Freundlich Absorption Theorem**, expressed as:

$$
\frac{Rs}{R_0} = A \cdot (C)^{-m}
$$


Where:  
- **Rs** = Sensor resistance in gas  
- **Râ‚€** = Resistance in clean air  
- **C** = Gas concentration (ppm)  
- **A, m** = Constants depending on gas type  

The datasheet provides **log-log plots of Rs/Râ‚€ vs ppm** for various gases, showing that sensor sensitivity decreases nonlinearly with increasing gas concentration.
